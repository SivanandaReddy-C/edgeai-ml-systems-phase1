## 📊 CNN vs Transformer Benchmark

| Metric | CNN | Transformer |
|------|------|------------|
| Training Time (1 epoch) | 17.36 s | 30.45 s |
| Single Inference Latency | 0.301 ms | 1.302 ms |
| Batch Latency (32) | 1.164 ms | 2.641 ms |
| Parameters | 206,922 | 102,474 |
| Peak Memory | ~335 MB | ~335 MB |
| Best DataLoader Workers | \- | 2 |
---

## 🔍 Key Insights (Phase 1)

- Transformer models have fewer parameters but higher computational complexity due to attention mechanisms (O(n²)).
- CNN is significantly faster for image-based tasks due to localized convolution operations.
- Transformer shows slower training and inference despite lower parameter count.
- Batch inference reduces the performance gap but CNN remains more efficient.
- Peak memory usage is similar for both models in this setup, indicating that activations and runtime dominate memory usage.
- DataLoader performance depends on system configuration and is independent of model architecture.

---

## 🧠 Engineering Learnings

- Parameter count alone does not determine model efficiency.
- Attention mechanisms introduce quadratic complexity with sequence length.
- Profiling tools like cProfile and memory_profiler are essential for identifying bottlenecks.
- Backpropagation is the most computationally expensive step in training.
- Data loading can become a bottleneck without proper tuning.
- Benchmarking should evaluate training, inference, and memory — not just accuracy.

# 🔹 Phase 2 — Deployment & Optimization

## 🎯 Objective

Convert trained models into **efficient deployment-ready systems**:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PyTorch → ONNX → Runtime → Quantization → Optimization  

---

## ⚙️ ONNX Deployment

### Model Export
- Converted PyTorch models to ONNX  
- Used dummy inputs to trace graph 

### Validation
- Verified using ONNX checker  
- Ensured inference compatibility  


### Inference (ONNX Runtime)
- Executed using ONNX Runtime (C++ backend)  
- Used NumPy arrays instead of PyTorch tensors

### 📊 Performance Comparison

| Model | PyTorch Latency | ONNX Latency |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| CNN  | 5.6070 ms      | 0.1009 ms   |

### Key Insight
ONNX significantly reduces latency by removing Python overhead and enabling graph-level optimizations.

---

## ⚡ Quantization (FP32 → INT8)

### Objective
Reduce precision to improve efficiency.

### Results

| Model | FP32 Latency | INT8 Latency |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| CNN  | 0.2623 ms    | 0.5262 ms    |

### Key Insight 
Quantization **did not improve performance** for this model because:
- Model is small  
- Limited layers were quantized  
- Overhead > compute savings  

👉 This highlights that optimization is **context-dependent**, not guaranteed.


---

## 🚀 Runtime Optimization

Applied ONNX Runtime graph optimizations + threading control.

| Model | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| FP32 | 0.0700 ms | 0.0400 ms |
| INT8 | 0.2200 ms | 0.0300 ms |

### Key Insight 
Runtime optimizations significantly improved performance and enabled INT8 to outperform FP32, highlighting the importance of execution-level tuning in deployment.

## 📦 Batch Size Analysis

| Batch | Batch Latency (ms) | Per-sample Latency (ms) |
|------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| 1    | 0.0365             | 0.0365                  |
| 2    | 0.0497             | 0.0249                  |
| 4    | 0.0901             | 0.0225                  |
| 8    | 0.1583             | 0.0198                  |
| 16   | 0.2868             | 0.0179                  |
| 32   | 0.5527             | 0.0173                  |

### Key Insights 
- Batch latency increases with batch size
- Per-sample latency decreases due to better compute utilization
- Diminishing returns observed beyond batch size 16–32

## ⚡ Threading & Parallelism

### Results

#### Batch = 1

| Threads | Latency |
|--------|--------|
| 1 | 0.0361 ms |
| 2 | 0.0364 ms |
| 4 | 0.0360 ms |
| 8 | 0.0400 ms |

👉 No improvement due to small workload  

---

#### Batch = 8

| Threads | Latency |
|--------|--------|
| 1 | 0.1574 ms |
| 2 | 0.0966 ms |
| 4 | 0.0784 ms |
| 8 | 0.0742 ms |

👉 ~2× speedup using parallelism  

---

### Key Insights

- Small workloads → threading overhead dominates  
- Larger workloads → parallelism improves performance  
- Gains saturate due to CPU limits  

💡 **Practical Insight:**
Real-world deployment requires tuning both batch size and threading together. Optimal performance is achieved by balancing latency, throughput, and hardware utilization.
