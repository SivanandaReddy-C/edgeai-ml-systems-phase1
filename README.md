## CNN Architecture
The implemented CNN architecture follows this pipeline:

Input (1x28x28)

Conv2d (1 → 16, kernel=3, padding=1)  
ReLU  
MaxPool (2×2)

Conv2d (16 → 32, kernel=3, padding=1)  
ReLU  
MaxPool (2×2)

Flatten

Fully Connected (1568 → 128)  
ReLU

Fully Connected (128 → 10)

Total Parameters:206,922

## Training Pipeline
The training loop follows the standard PyTorch workflow:   
Forward Pass → Loss Calculation → Backpropagation → Optimizer Update

Components:
- Loss: CrossEntropyLoss
- Optimizer: Adam
- Dataset: MNIST

## Transformer Encoder Architecture

## Benchmark Results
| Metric | Value |
|------|------|
Model | CNN |
Parameters | 206,922 |
Training Time (1 epoch) | 19.09 s |
Single Inference Latency | 0.050 ms |
Batch Inference Latency (32) | 1.215 ms |
Peak Memory Usage | ~335 MB |
Best DataLoader Workers | 2 |

### Observations
- Backpropagation (`run_backward`) was the most compute-intensive operation.
- Peak memory usage was observed during forward/backward passes due to stored activations.
- DataLoader performance was optimal with `num_workers=2`.

## How to Run
