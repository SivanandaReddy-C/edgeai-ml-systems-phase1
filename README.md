## CNN Architecture
The implemented CNN architecture follows this pipeline:

Input (1x28x28)

Conv2d (1 → 16, kernel=3, padding=1)  
ReLU  
MaxPool (2×2)

Conv2d (16 → 32, kernel=3, padding=1)  
ReLU  
MaxPool (2×2)

Flatten

Fully Connected (1568 → 128)  
ReLU

Fully Connected (128 → 10)

Total Parameters: 206,922

## Transformer Encoder Architecture
The Transformer encoder is implemented using multi-head self-attention and feed-forward layers stacked sequentially.

## Training Pipeline
The training loop follows a model-agnostic PyTorch workflow applicable to both CNN and Transformer models:  
Forward Pass → Loss Calculation → Backpropagation → Optimizer Update

Components:
- Loss: CrossEntropyLoss
- Optimizer: Adam
- Dataset: MNIST

## CNN vs Transformer Comparison

| Metric | CNN | Transformer |
|------|------|------------|
| Training Time (1 epoch) | 17.36 s | 30.45 s |
| Single Inference Latency | 0.301 ms | 1.302 ms |
| Batch Inference Latency (32) | 1.164 ms | 2.641 ms |
| Parameters | 206,922 | 102,474 |
| Peak Memory Usage | ~335 MB | ~335 MB |
| Best DataLoader Workers | \- | 2 |

## Key Insights

- Transformer models have fewer parameters but higher computational complexity due to attention mechanisms (O(n²)).
- CNN is significantly faster for image-based tasks due to localized convolution operations.
- Transformer shows slower training and inference despite lower parameter count.
- Batch inference reduces the performance gap but CNN remains more efficient.
- Peak memory usage is similar for both models in this setup, indicating that activations and runtime dominate memory usage.
- DataLoader performance depends on system configuration and is independent of model architecture.

## Engineering Learnings

- Parameter count alone does not determine model efficiency.
- Attention mechanisms introduce quadratic complexity with sequence length.
- Profiling tools like cProfile and memory_profiler are essential for identifying bottlenecks.
- Backpropagation is the most computationally expensive step in training.
- Data loading can become a bottleneck without proper tuning.
- Benchmarking should evaluate training, inference, and memory — not just accuracy.

## Highlights

- Built CNN and Transformer models from scratch
- Implemented modular training pipeline with YAML configuration
- Performed system-level benchmarking and profiling
- Compared architectures based on performance, not just accuracy

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete ML systems pipeline including model implementation, training, profiling, and benchmarking.

CNN models are more efficient for image-based tasks due to optimized convolution operations, while Transformer models provide architectural flexibility but introduce higher computational overhead.

This comparison highlights the importance of evaluating machine learning models from a systems perspective rather than relying solely on accuracy or parameter count.
